"""Slither is a next-generation software product aimed at making
personal computers more useful.

Slither includes a new type of database, a web server and an automation
engine designed to fit modern workflows in such a way as to maximize utility
across your organization.

# slitherd

slitherd provides an instance-wide PubSub broker which can arrange to
pass messages to all subscribers of a given topic and all parent-topics.
subscribers are Python callable objects which are executed within a
thread or process pool.

slitherd also provides a plugin feature which allows you to create plugins
using python setuptools.entry_points which should be a callable which will
accept three arguments: broker, path, args. This callable is expected
to run forever and will be restarted if it exits, this callable should expect
to be killed without notice.

slitherd comes with three standard plugins: tictok, files and automan. tictok will
publish the current time to the "time.tick" topic every second and to
the "time.tock" topic every minute. The files plugin scans path recursively
every 60 seconds and publishes all directories found to "filesystem.directory"
and every file found to "filesystem.file"

# Slitherdb

Slitherdb is a new type of database. Everything in Slitherdb is a Resource.
Every Resource has an identity, content and hash. The identity is a Globally
Unique Identifier which is added to a local registry and is used to prove
the existence of data and to add to audit chains.
